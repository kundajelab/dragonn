Loading this dataset into memory to pass as a numpy array to the CNN code will require more memory than is available on many machines. Consequently, we use the [keras fit_generator](https://keras.io/models/sequential/#fit_generator) function to limit the memory footprint. This function reads in one batch of training and one batch of validation data at a time from a python generator. in *dragonn.generators*, we provide several python generator functions to match the scenarios below.

    "* Training the models genome-wide by splitting the genome into short (200 bp), overlapping (stride=50) bins leads to improved generalization performance on the test set as compared to \"easier\" negative sets. I.E we observed superior test set performance for both the SPI1 and CTCF tasks when training on the whole genome as compared to using shuffled reference negatives. \n",

    "* Due to high class imbalance in *in vivo* data, it is necessary to upsample positive examples in each batch to facilitate model training. We found that upsampling positives to constitute 30% of each batch worked well --i.e. interpretation with DeepLIFT indicates the model learned the correct motif in CTCF and SPI1 ChIP-seq datasets. What happens if you alter the *upsample_ratio* parameter in the generator function? Does the model learn equally well with *upsample_ratio=0.1*? Does it learn better or worse with *upsample_ratio=0.5*? \n",
